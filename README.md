# FeeMe - Free Text Menu Ordering

Welcome to the **FeeMe** repository! This open-source project enables users to select items from a restaurant menu by Talking / writing or Even taking a picture (Future) freely instead of manually choosing each item. FeeMe intelligently matches the user's description to the closest items available on the menu.

### System Digrams

### Example Use Case
Instead of selecting individual menu items, users can simply type:

```
I would like 2 hamburgers without ketchup, 1 veggie burger, 2 fries, 2 Coca-Colas, and 1 chocolate ice cream.
```

The system will parse this prompt, understand the order, and create an itemized list based on the restaurant's menu. FeeMe also works to match the user's description to the closest available items, ensuring their wishes are met even if exact matches aren't available.
